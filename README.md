FolderOrganizer
===============
This is an incredibly useful mini Mac Osx app written in Objective C that takes all files in a specified target folder and then groups them by the time they were last accessed. It will really come in handy when your desktop, harddrive or any folder is extremely cluttered and you want a quick solution to bring back order and organization to your life.
